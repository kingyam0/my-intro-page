# Project Description

This project is a simple profile introduction page built with React. The page includes a header section with the profile details, along with links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

## Code Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `App.js`: This file contains the main component of the application. It imports the necessary dependencies, including the CSS file and the required image assets. Inside the `App` component, the profile information is structured using HTML elements and React components.

- `App.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the application. It defines the layout and appearance of the profile introduction page, including the positioning of the profile image, logos, and text.

- Image Assets: The project includes three image assets located in the `assets` directory: `github-logo.png`, `linkedin-logo.png`, and `code-image.png`. These images are used to display the GitHub logo, LinkedIn logo, and the code image in the profile introduction page.

## Component Structure

The main component, `App`, is responsible for rendering the profile introduction page. Here's an overview of the component structure:

- The `App` component is wrapped in a `div` element with the class name `App`.

- Inside the `App` component, there is a `header` element with the class name `App-header`.

- The profile information is divided into two main sections using `div` elements:

  1. The first section contains the profile details, including the introduction, name, and job title. These elements are wrapped within the `content-container`, `intro-container`, `Intro`, `Name`, and `JobTitle` classes.

  2. The second section contains the code image and the logos. The code image is displayed using an `img` element with the class name `code-image`. The logos for GitHub and LinkedIn are displayed using `img` elements wrapped within `a` tags. The logos are contained within a `div` element with the class name `logo-container`.
